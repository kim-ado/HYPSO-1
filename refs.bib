ABSTRACT = {Satellite onboard processing for hyperspectral imaging applications is characterized by large data sets, limited processing resources and limited bandwidth of communication links. The CCSDS-123 algorithm is a specialized compression standard assembled for space-related applications. In this paper, a parallel FPGA implementation of CCSDS-123 compression algorithm is presented. The proposed design can compress any number of samples in parallel allowed by resource and I/O bandwidth constraints. The CCSDS-123 processing core has been placed on Zynq-7035 SoC and verified against the existing reference software. The estimated power use scales approximately linearly with the number of samples processed in parallel. Finally, the proposed implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art implementations in terms of both throughput and power.},

abstract = {Hawkeye is an ocean color instrument that is part of the SeaHawk satellite developed for SOCON, the Sustained Ocean Color Observations using Nanosatellites program funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and managed by the University of North Carolina – Wilmington (UNC-W). HawkEye has spectral characteristics similar to SeaWiFS, but with 8 times finer resolution and a smaller field of view more appropriate for lakes, rivers, and near-shore terrestrial environments. With a volume of only 10 &times; 10 &times; 10 cm (a CubeSat 1U), it can produce 8 bands of image data in a single pass, each with 1800 &times; 6000 pixels, with a resolution of 120 meters per pixel. This paper will present a short summary of instrument design, the spacecraft interface, and "lessons learned" during this effort. Scientists considering using linear arrays in a pushbroom mode for remote sensing will find this useful. Much of the discussion will center on optical performance, such as flat field calibration, polarization effects, stray light, out-of-band response, and exposure linearity. Images from field tests will be shown.},

abstract = {The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor designed specifically for the coastal ocean and estuarial, riverine, or other shallow-water areas. The HICO generates hyperspectral images, primarily over the 400--900 nm spectral range, with a ground sample distance of $\approx$90 m (at nadir) and a high signal-to-noise ratio. The HICO is now operating on the International Space Station (ISS). Its cross-track and along-track fields of view are 42 km (at nadir) and 192 km, respectively, for a total scene area of 8000 km2. The HICO is an innovative prototype sensor that builds on extensive experience with airborne sensors and makes extensive use of commercial off-the-shelf components to build a space sensor at a small fraction of the usual cost and time. Here we describe the instrument's design and characterization and present early images from the ISS.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional tools and methodologies for mesoscale observation of oceanographic phenomena are limited by under-sampling and data latency. In this article we evaluate three different scenario variants of an architecture for how heterogeneous sensor nodes can be integrated with satellite remote sensing. Independent space and marine sensing platforms are interconnected either directly or by means of a ground-based mission control center responsible for data processing, relay, and coordination of the assets. A wave-propelled unmanned surface vehicle (USV) persistently collects in situ data of the targeted phenomenon. In two variants of the architecture, a dedicated small satellite acts as a sensor node, a data processing facility and a communication node. We have used a System-of-Systems (SoS) modeling approach coupled with operational simulations in different locations on Earth, in order to support the proposed methodology and investigate quantitatively the reduction the data latency to end-users. Through a combination of field experiments and simulations we estimate how the different scenarios perform with respect to providing remote sensing data that are used to create a measurement and navigation plan for the autonomous vessel.},

ABSTRACT = {We describe advanced spectral and radiometric calibration techniques developed for NASA&rsquo;s Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). By employing both statistically rigorous analysis and utilizing in situ data to inform calibration procedures and parameter estimation, we can dramatically reduce undesirable artifacts and minimize uncertainties of calibration parameters notoriously difficult to characterize in the laboratory. We describe a novel approach for destriping imaging spectrometer data through minimizing a Markov Random Field model. We then detail statistical methodology for bad pixel correction of the instrument, followed by the laboratory and field protocols involved in the corrections and evaluate their effectiveness on historical data. Finally, we review the geometric processing procedure used in production of the radiometrically calibrated image data.},

ABSTRACT = {Developing reliable methodologies of data quality assessment is of paramount importance for maximizing the exploitation of Earth observation (EO) products. Among the different factors influencing EO optical image quality, sharpness has a relevant role. When implementing on-orbit approaches of sharpness assessment, such as the edge method, a crucial step that strongly affects the final results is the selection of suitable edges to use for the analysis. Within this context, this paper aims at proposing a semi-automatic, statistically-based edge method (SaSbEM) that exploits edges extracted from natural targets easily and largely available on Earth: agricultural fields. For each image that is analyzed, SaSbEM detects numerous suitable edges (e.g., dozens-hundreds) characterized by specific geometrical and statistical criteria. This guarantees the repeatability and reliability of the analysis. Then, it implements a standard edge method to assess the sharpness level of each edge. Finally, it performs a statistical analysis of the results to have a robust characterization of the image sharpness level and its uncertainty. The method was validated by using Landsat 8 L1T products. Results proved that: SaSbEM is capable of performing a reliable and repeatable sharpness assessment; Landsat 8 L1T data are characterized by very good sharpness performance.},

  abstract={The recent surge in interest towards hyperspectral imagery has the potential to unlock a new range of applications for the scientific community. However, compared to traditional multi-spectral images, the workload required to process such high-dimensional data is dramatically increased, to the point that new and more flexible strategies must be developed in order to properly monitor the quality of this type of products. In the particular case of sharpness assessment, traditional procedures based on the edge method tend to be extremely time-consuming due to their reliance on visual analysis performed by human operators, and would make proper processing of all bands a daunting task to perform on a large scale. In this paper we propose a flexible and fully automatic approach to edge method-based sharpness assessment that can be applied inde-pendently from the number of spectral bands. We then present the results of the application of the methodology on the visible and near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral cubes of a selection of PRISMA L2D images, which confirm the relia-bility of the methodology and suggest further improvements.}
