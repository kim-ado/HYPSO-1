abstract = {Abstract Norway has a large coastal industry and a strong motivation for developing systems to enable sustainable management of ocean resources. Recent advances in collaborating autonomous systems, Internet-of-Things, microsatellites, data fusion, and sensor development have led to initiatives for a more concerted and coordinated effort through the establishment of an ocean studies research project. Applying a System-of-Systems perspective on the project highlights the challenges in terms of interoperability and communication interfaces, as well as revealing the use-cases stakeholders rely on to enable informed decision-making.},

  abstract =  {Satellite communications have been widely used to provide connectivity around the world. However, regions such as the Arctic still have limited coverage, despite the need to monitor this region. Currently, several sensors are deployed in the Arctic, but are limited by poor and costly connectivity. Constellations of small satellites, or CubeSats, have been proposed in order to overcome this lack of connectivity, offering an alternative to typical satellite solutions. However, these constellations face challenges in their deployment and in orbital station keeping. In this paper, we propose a simpler deployment of small satellites, in the form of a drifting swarm, integrated with networking protocols widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT). A realistic setup is considered, evaluating this solution taking into account the position of sensor nodes, ground stations and the dynamics of such a drifting swarm. The topology evolution of the small-satellite swarm is studied and all its link characteristics are emulated using a real network stack and protocols. The obtained results prove the feasibility of the proposed solution and show that a freely drifting satellite swarm, with three small satellites, outperforms more costly solutions. Our results also show that by using standardised networking protocols, a satellite architecture with two ground stations connected over the Internet, can reduce the average end-to-end time of a request from 88 to 38 min. The obtained results motivate the use of freely drifting swarms of small satellites for reaching sensor nodes in remote locations, as well as the use of IoT protocols for improved performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional tools and methodologies for mesoscale observation of oceanographic phenomena are limited by under-sampling and data latency. In this article we evaluate three different scenario variants of an architecture for how heterogeneous sensor nodes can be integrated with satellite remote sensing. Independent space and marine sensing platforms are interconnected either directly or by means of a ground-based mission control center responsible for data processing, relay, and coordination of the assets. A wave-propelled unmanned surface vehicle (USV) persistently collects in situ data of the targeted phenomenon. In two variants of the architecture, a dedicated small satellite acts as a sensor node, a data processing facility and a communication node. We have used a System-of-Systems (SoS) modeling approach coupled with operational simulations in different locations on Earth, in order to support the proposed methodology and investigate quantitatively the reduction the data latency to end-users. Through a combination of field experiments and simulations we estimate how the different scenarios perform with respect to providing remote sensing data that are used to create a measurement and navigation plan for the autonomous vessel.},
